imchat
======

imchat is a simple instant message chat system that uses AJAX and PHP to request and create chat messages. imchat is designed to be as visually customizable as possible, for that reason the script will not create any HTML or CSS for you, instead you should supply the script with the classnames you use when creating the markup. Alternitevelly you can use the pre-defined class names.
